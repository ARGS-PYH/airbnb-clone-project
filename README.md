## üß∞ Technology Stack

This section outlines the core technologies used in the **Airbnb Clone Project** and their specific roles in building a scalable backend system.

| Technology | Description |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Django** | A high-level Python web framework that simplifies backend development by providing built-in tools for routing, ORM, authentication, and security. It serves as the core of the backend system. |
| **Django REST Framework (DRF)** | A powerful and flexible toolkit for building RESTful APIs in Django. It simplifies serialization, authentication, and API endpoint creation. |
| **PostgreSQL** | A robust open-source relational database used for storing structured data such as users, properties, bookings, and payments. |
| **GraphQL** | A query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, improving efficiency and reducing over-fetching. |
| **Celery** | A distributed task queue used for handling asynchronous operations like sending email notifications or processing background tasks (e.g., payment confirmations). |
| **Redis** | An in-memory data store used for caching and message brokering, improving performance by reducing load on the main database. |
| **Docker** | A containerization tool that ensures consistent environments across development and deployment stages by packaging applications with all dependencies. |
| **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)** | Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines that automate testing, building, and deployment processes for reliable delivery. |

### üß© Additional Tools (Optional Enhancements)
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **OpenAPI / Swagger** | For interactive API documentation and testing. |
| **Nginx** | Acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer for serving the application efficiently. |
| **Gunicorn** | A WSGI HTTP server used to serve Django applications in production. |
